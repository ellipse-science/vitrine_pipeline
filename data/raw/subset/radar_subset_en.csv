“This has upset a lot of people,” said Robert Gordon, Humber’s longest serving president (1982-2007), who continues to be in contact with staff and alumni as president emeritus. “The climate of trust and co-operation has deteriorated because people don’t know where they stand … The morale is poor.”
A mass resignation is “very unusual,” said Glen Jones, a professor of higher education at the University of Toronto and an expert on governance. “The fact that something like this has happened at a college that is so well respected is shocking.”
He said he doesn’t have inside knowledge, but “it clearly suggests some sort of tremendous tension between the board and the president, and that’s not good for the college and it’s not good for the people of Ontario who rely on Humber as a very important educational institution.”
The ministry told the Star that “this fact-finding exercise is designed to assist all parties with implementing best practices in governance.

“I am thankful that the paramedic is recovering from their injuries,” she said. “Thank you to police from our neighbouring municipalities, who came to help ensure the situation resolved without further injury.”

While first responders are trained to deal with dangerous events, “it is never OK for [them] to themselves be under attack while they are saving lives,” said Alto. “This incident is under investigation by VicPD, and I will continue to work with them and all our first responders on next steps.”

Alto said she continues to urge the provincial government to recognize the challenges facing municipalities “as we respond to the urgent issues of homelessness, mental health and addictions that are impacting Victoria and the rest of B.C., precipitated by gaps in health and housing programs and services.”

A longtime Trudeau critic, Peterson clearly relished the idea of a Canadian government more aligned with the Trump administration, and the economic growth he argues that would spur. “It looks like Canada and the U.S. are going to be aligned sufficiently politically to make that a reality,” he said. “And I would say, to some degree, that’s probably really the first time that’s been the case in living memory.”
Poilievre’s basic message remained the same: that by cutting regulation on things like oil production and housing development, and by clamping down on government spending, Canada can’t help but unleash greater prosperity.
“We have an incredible country, and I think we have a very bright future,” Poilievre said. “I can’t wait to see what we do and the example we set for the world.”

www_theglobeandmail_com_canada_article-foreign-interference-report-release__20250128_201354,2025-01-28,"She told reporters that Ottawa must do a better job of informing Canadians. “Most Canadians first learned about foreign interference through media reports and without the government being the source of the information communicated” Justice Hogue said. “This should not have been the case.”

She concluded the government has been, “overall a poor communicator when it comes to foreign interference” in Canada.

“The risk of leaks increases if government agencies keep such incidents almost entirely secret, and the dependency on investigative reporting will persist,” she said. “Properly informed, I have no doubt that Canadians will be able to understand what foreign interference is and help defend Canadian democracy against this threat.”

Justice Hogue’s 51 recommendations include: a hotline for Canadians to report foreign interference and a prohibition on allowing foreigners other than permanent residents to vote in nomination or leadership contests",GAM

“Bike lanes should only go where they make sense,” said Dakota Brasier, Sarkaria’s director of media relations. “It’s clear that the city’s approach isn’t working and we encourage them to listen to the thousands of common sense drivers to help clear our major roads and get people out of traffic.”
In an email to the Star on Wednesday night, Mayor Olivia Chow said that the money needed to remove the lanes could be better spent elsewhere. 
“With family budgets squeezed across our city, the millions it’s estimated to cost to remove these lanes (and make people less safe on our roads) could be better spent on feeding all kids in our city through our school food program or help to build more housing.”
Speaking to reporters Wednesday morning ahead of the report’s release, Chow called the province’s plan “arbitrary” and said the city intended to put forward evidence of the impact of removing bike lanes.
“They need to look at our numbers,” she said.

“There hasn’t been a strong message or a strong response on what they believe, what their policy might be in this,” Blades said, adding that if Rustad doesn’t put to paper policy on what a Conservative government would do, he runs the risk of ceding the narrative to the NDP.

“The NDP are trying to create these social issues as a polarizing divide and focus on the social stance of the leader and some of his personal thoughts,” she said. “If they do it and they put some money behind more ads on this issue, well, guess what?

Charlie Kirk, founder of the conservative youth organization Turning Point, which is playing a key role in the campaign’s get-out-the-vote operation, has said that any man who votes against Trump is “not a man.” Kirk also has said wives who covertly vote for Harris “undermine their husbands” — describing a man “who probably works his tail off to make sure that she can go and have a nice life and provide to the family.”

On Saturday night, Trump laughed along with a crude joke about Harris, nearly a week after a speaker at his Madison Square Garden rally suggested the vice-president was like a prostitute controlled by “pimp handlers.”
As Trump repeated his claim, made without evidence, that Harris lied about working at McDonalds in her youth, someone in the crowd yelled, “She worked on the corner.”
Trump laughed, looked around and pointed toward a section of the crowd.

Vanier was among CEGEPs that had asked the government to delay the implementation of the new requirements, but that request was denied.
