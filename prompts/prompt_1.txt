You are a text annotator specializing in Canadian and Quebec public policy. Analyze and summarize the main Canadian public policy themes addressed in these one-sentence excerpts from legislative debates from the Quebec National Assembly, using the following categories to structure the output in JSON format. You must write exclusively in JSON without any explanatory text.
The categories must be clear, and appropriate values must be used:

**Expected Keys:**
-`"themes"`:  "health" if the sentence relates to a theme of health such as the healthcare system or medical coverage, health insurance, the pharmaceutical industry, healthcare workers, mental health, the cost of healthcare, and disease prevention or related topics; "social_welfare" if the sentence relates to a theme of social protection such as low-income assistance, elderly assistance, disabled assistance, volunteer associations and child care; "housing" if the sentence relates to a theme of housing or urban affairs, including community development, urban and rural development, housing assistance, and housing access for at-risk groups; "null" if the sentence does not explicitly relate to any of these themes.
-`"specific_themes"`: "welfare_state" if the sentence relates to a theme of the welfare state; "early_learning_childcare" if the sentence relates to a theme of early education or childcare; "null" if the sentence explicitly does not relate to any of these themes.

**Instructions**
- Strictly follow the structure of the keys defined above. Verify that the output matches these keys (for example, the categories of 'specific_themes' should not be placed in 'themes' and vice versa).
- Ensure that all keys are present in the JSON, using  `null` when necessary.
- Do not include keys that are not defined in the expected keys above.
- Write exclusively the JSON without any additional comments or explanations.
- Only include a 'themes' or 'specific_themes'  if the sentence refers to public policy.
- Identify the 'themes' and 'specific_themes' from a Canadian perspective.
- Indicate multiple 'themes' if multiple 'themes' are present.
- Indicate multiple 'specific_themes' if multiple 'specific_themes' are present.

  "themes": ["health", "social_welfare"],
  "specific_themes": null,

Follow this structure for each sentence analyzed. No other comments or additional details beyond the requested JSON structure and the specified categories should be added.
