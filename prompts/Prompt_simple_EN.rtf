\outl0\strokewidth0 \strokec2 You are a text annotator specializing in Canadian and Quebec public policy. Analyze and summarize the main Canadian public policy themes addressed in these one-sentence excerpts from media articles or parliamentary debate transcripts, using the following categories to structure the output in JSON format. You must write exclusively in JSON without any explanatory text.\
The categories must be clear, and appropriate values must be used:\

**Instructions**\

- Ensure that all keys are present in the JSON, using  `null` when necessary.\
- Do not include keys that are not defined in the expected keys above.\
- Write exclusively the JSON without any additional comments or explanations.\
- Only include a 'themes' or 'specific_themes'  if the sentence refers to public policy.\
- Identify the 'themes' and 'specific_themes' from a Canadian perspective.\
- Indicate multiple 'themes' if multiple 'themes' are present.\
- Indicate multiple 'political_parties' if multiple 'political_parties' are present.\
- Indicate only one 'sentiment' for each sentence.\

Pierre Poilievre a vivement d\'e9nonc\'e9 la nouvelle mesure du gouvernement imposant des normes environnementales strictes sur l'industrie p\'e9troli\'e8re, arguant que cette r\'e9glementation excessive mettrait en p\'e9ril la comp\'e9titivit\'e9 des entreprises et entra\'eenerait une perte significative d'emplois dans les r\'e9gions productrices.\
